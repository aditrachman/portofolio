            I was born in <span className="text-white font-medium">Magelang, Indonesia</span>, and I'm a frontend developer
            and data analyst. Since an early age, I've been fascinated by
            technology and creativity, which led me to explore how things work
            and how data can shape better decisions.

            My journey combines the art of creating beautiful, functional user interfaces
            with the science of extracting meaningful insights from data. I believe that
            great products are born from the intersection of design, technology, and data-driven decisions.
